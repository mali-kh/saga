    - The original algorithm does not consider heterogenous communication strengths between
      network nodes. This affects the ipc_overhead term in the BIL definition. We compute the
      ipc_overhead between two tasks by scaling the cost by the average communication weight
      in the network.
        Original: BIL(task, node) = task_cost / node_speed + max(BIL(child, node) + ipc_overhead)
